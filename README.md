Hey, I’m Sha256dow, aka Teuz.
I’m interested in learning new subjects about I.T and correlatives.
I’m currently learning Python and Cybersecurity, so I want to unite them both.
You'll be able to contact me on Sha256dow@outlook.com :)
Sometimes i'll post some random programming lines that not even exist, but i sure you guys that i'm not schizo.
